# üéº Music_Sheet_to_MIDI

**MusicSheetToMIDI is an incomplete project and was my very first python coding experience.**

## Project Overview

This project's primary objective was to create an [Optical Music Recognition program (OMR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_music_recognition) capable of generating a [Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) file from a scanned or photographed music sheet image. <br>
"https://github.com/Sawful/Music_Sheet_to_MIDI/blob/master/Midi_files/example.mp3?raw=true"<br>
Currently, this program enables the MIDI file generation with the desired musical notes. <br>

A basic user interface implemented with [pyQT5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyQt) allows an intuitive computation. <br>
While those functionalities have their merits, progress on the project was hindered by the absence of a reliable method to recognize and interpret different musical notes on the input music sheet. <br>

## Development Challenges

Several approaches were attempted to address the note recognition challenge, including [template matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_matching), [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) and the training of an artificial intelligence (AI) model. <br>
However, none of these methods yielded the desired results, leading to the decision to discontinue the project. <br>

## Lessons Learned

This project has provided valuable learning experiences /5‚≠ê such as:

- **Conda efficiency** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê: I gained knowledge in using the Conda console, including creating Conda environments, installing libraries, and navigating directories within the console.
- **Library execution** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê: I was able to understand and utilize several libraries in this project.
- **Image recognition** ‚≠ê: Even though this part does not figure into the project, I learnt and tried different methods to identify an object in a picture.
- **Object-Oriented Programming** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: I learned in this project how to code in classes and definitions.
- **Debugging with PyCharm** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: I became familiar with using the PyCharm debugger, including setting breakpoints for efficient debugging.
- **Code Formatting** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê: I got familiar with code formatting practices using ["black‚Äù](https://github.com/psf/black) to ensure cleaner and more consistent code.
- **GitHub Usage** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: I learned how to create and manage a GitHub repository, including the creation of a README file.
- **Git Version Control** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê: I acquired skills in using [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) to perform Git operations such as pulling, committing, and pushing changes to a repository. As well as ignoring file modification (.gitignore) and cloning a repo.
